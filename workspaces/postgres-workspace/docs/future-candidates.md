__Potential candidates__
- [sqlpipe](https://sqlpipe.com/about/). Looks great. Haven't tried yet.
- [dbmate](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate)
- [pg_back](https://github.com/orgrim/pg_back)
- [trdsql](https://github.com/noborus/trdsql#PostgreSQL)
- [eralchemy](https://github.com/Alexis-benoist/eralchemy). Functionality already available in schemaspy. Can be useful for custom doc preparation.
- [datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette). Nice, but does not really fit the purpose of the workspace. Pgclimb can generate HTML.
- [rclone gui](https://rclone.org/gui/). Nice, but is not really needed. Problems with removing basic auth
- [OctoSQL](https://github.com/cube2222/octosql). Nice, but has limitations: only Postgres public schema can be queried; does not allow uppercase in table names;  lack of flexibility parsing csv
- [nancy](https://gitlab.com/postgres-ai/nancy). Lack of maintenance recently.
- [azimutt](https://github.com/azimuttapp/azimutt). Lack of maturity.
- [planter](https://github.com/achiku/planter).
- [pgsh](https://github.com/sastraxi/pgsh). Lack of documentation.
- [dbvisualizer](https://github.com/eska-muc/dbvisualizer). Functionality is already covered in schemaspy.
- [er-diagram-endpoint](https://github.com/kedziorski/er-diagram-endpoint). Lack of recent updates.
- [pgdiff](https://github.com/joncrlsn/pgdiff). Pgdiff compares the schema between two PostgreSQL 9 databases. NNice, but last release is in 2017. Also, Migra covers the same functionality.
